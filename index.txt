Austin Barnhart- Section 03 - Dr. Eloe / 10am

Hi my name is Austin Barnhart and I am currently a Junior majoring in Computer Science. I am from a small town called Rosendale, Missouri located 15 minutes south of Maryville. My hobbies include hunting, football, and video games. 

After college, I hope to land a job in Database Management in the Kansas City area. I would prefer a database job that focuses mainly on maintaining databases, but it would be very interesting to also create an entire new database.

Something unique about me is that I enjoy making Discord servers for online communities.
